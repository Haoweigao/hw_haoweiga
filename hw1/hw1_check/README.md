# CS104 HW1 Checker

This checker contains a subset of the tests that we'll grade your homework on.  It's meant to help verify that the basic functionality of your program works, but it doesn't cover every corner case.

### Using the Tests
1. Copy this directory into your `hw1` folder
2. Open a terminal and cd into `hw1_check`
3. Initialize the test suite by running `cmake .`
4. Build the code: `make`
5. Run the tests: `ctest`
